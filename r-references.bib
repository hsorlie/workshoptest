  abstract = {In the present investigation longitudinal data obtained from recruits undergoing basic military training in the Swiss Armed Forces were used to examine the effects of organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) on a subsequent cadre selection and the willingness to voluntarily pursue a career as militia cadre. Results of the hierarchical logistic regression controlling for demographic variables, cadre recommendation, and allocation to the desired branch of service showed OCB predicted both the selection as cadre and the voluntariness to pursue a career as militia cadre. These effects show to what extent OCB may predict significant additional effort. Results are discussed with regard to further examination of the effects of OCB on career outcomes and selection decisions.},
